    "experiment_description": "\nExperiment description:\nThis script is used to train a logistic regression model to classify sex based on\nbrain imaging data. The data is split into training and testing sets using repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set, with results saved to a CSV file. The script also generates a JSON file containing experiment information.\nAll sites are pooled together and then they are sampled with two different sampling methods: low_Q and high_Q.\nThe low_Q method retains images with higher IQR values, while the high_Q method retains images with lower IQR values. The script uses a confound regressor to regress out the effect of Total Intracranial Volume (TIV) from the data before training the model.\n",
